In Cosmobox will message statuses such as "✅(delivered)" and "✅✅(seen)" be managed through peer-to-peer communication rather than relying on Cosmobox's servers. Here is a general outline of how this process might work:

Message Sent: When a user sends a message, it is encrypted and sent directly to the recipient's device.
Message Delivered: When the recipient's device receives the message, it sends an acknowledgment back to the sender's device indicating that the message has been delivered.
Message Seen: When the recipient reads the message, another acknowledgment is sent back to the sender's device indicating that the message has been seen.
